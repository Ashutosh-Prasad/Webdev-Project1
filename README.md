# Webdev-Project1

  This is a website i have designed for my personal webdev project during my html css journey it has no backend for now and this is no for any commerical usage 
  It has basic features like a landing page,Login page and Sign Up page
  While i was learning the Landing page is not optimised for Phone Devices as i did not learn use of flex at that time so works only in Desktop devices for now except the login page
  
  some of the images(photos) are designed by me and some i got from the internet(First top.png,Login Background.jpg,) of which the link to the sources i will update soon
